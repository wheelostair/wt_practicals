<h1>Alastair Cox Web Tech Assessment</h1>

<h2>Background</h2> 

The problem i would like to solve is the issue around working space during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time we have been advised to keep socailly distanced and a suggested two meter rule has been in place. I would like to make a website where you can book a desk at a place of work in the Isle of Wight Council.

My website would consist of an Index page which shows the buildings available to book a desk at, three pages which show the layouts of the desks and the buildings themselves and a single page for data capture 

<h2>Wire Frames</h2> 

Below is a rough idea of what i would like my website to look like.
