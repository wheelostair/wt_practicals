<h1>Alastair Cox Web Tech Assessment</h1>

<h2>Background</h2> 

The problem i would like to solve is the issue around working space during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time we have been advised to keep socailly distanced and a suggested two meter rule has been in place. I would like to make a website where you can book a desk at a place of work in the Isle of Wight Council.

My website would consist of an Index page which shows the buildings available to book a desk at, three pages which show the layouts of the desks and the buildings themselves and a single page for data capture 

<h2>Wire Frames</h2> 



Below is a rough idea of what i would like my index page on my website to look like.

Below is a rough idea of what i would like the building pages to look like. Each page will show the specific info for each bulidning, but the overall layout will be the same.

<h2>Colour Choices</h2>

The colour choice for my website was made by the current Isle of Wight Council website (https://www.iow.gov.uk), although this page wouldn't be available to members of the public, (as its only members of the ICT team who need to access it) I made the decision to keep they styling of the main IOW council website so that the users recognise what it is for. Beacuse the site isn't viewable by the general public the design of the page can differ from the council original.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

I have made my website accessible in a number of ways. I have used equivilent text alternatives to pictures for those who are unable to see and are using a screen reader.
I have also made the font a larger size, for those who have difficulty seeing smaller sizes, the font is Dark on a lighter background making it easier to distinguish.

<h2>GDPR</h2>

Whilst creating my website I have treid to follow the General Data Protection Regulations as best i can, paying attention to the 8 individual rights. I have linked the IOW council privicy notice in the footer of each of the pages so that this is availbe for my users to view at any time. My form won't actually submit any Data at present and as such there is no need for me to make possible the right to erasure or rectification. 

<h2>Distance Selling</h2>

As my website isn't selling any goods or services i didn't need to follow any of the guidlines around distance selling, however i still made sure to provide a business name, contact details, address and a description of what the website is trying to achieve on each page.  

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

TO be completed once i have actually done some work!
